This notebook implements a full pipeline for analyzing and predicting the price movement of the NIFTY 50 index using historical data. The workflow is divided into several sections:

1. Data Acquisition
Data Source:
The notebook uses the yfinance library to fetch historical market data for the NIFTY 50 index.
The ticker used is ^NSEI, which corresponds to the NIFTY 50 index on Yahoo Finance.

Data Range:
Data is downloaded from the earliest available date (e.g., 2007-09-17) up to a recent date (e.g., 2025-03-07).
The raw data includes key columns such as Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Dividends, and Stock Splits.

2. Data Preprocessing
Cleaning Data:
Unnecessary columns such as Dividends and Stock Splits are removed from the dataset since they are not used for prediction.

Feature Engineering:

Tomorrow's Price:
A new column Tomorrow is created by shifting the Close price one day ahead.

Target Creation:
A binary target variable (Target) is defined based on whether the next day’s closing price is higher than the current day’s close.

If Tomorrow > Close, the target is set to 1 (indicating an upward movement); otherwise, it is 0.

Rolling Statistics:
The notebook further computes several technical features over multiple time horizons (e.g., 2, 5, 60, 250, 1000 days):

Close Ratios:
For each horizon, a new feature (e.g., Close_Ratio_2) is computed as the ratio of the current close price to the rolling mean of the close price.

Trend Measures:
A trend feature (e.g., Trend_2) is generated by taking a rolling sum of the shifted Target values over the given horizon.

These additional features are appended to the main DataFrame and aggregated into a list (new_predictors) for use in the prediction models.

Handling Missing Data:
After feature engineering, rows containing any missing values (NaNs) are dropped to ensure clean inputs for model training.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization
Plotting Price History:
The notebook uses Matplotlib to plot the historical Close prices of NIFTY 50. The plot is formatted with a large figure size, labeled axes, and a legend for clarity.

Visual Confirmation of Data:
The notebook displays the updated DataFrame (with engineered features) to verify that columns such as Tomorrow, Target, and the rolling features have been correctly computed.

4. Model Training and Evaluation
Train-Test Split:
The dataset is split into training and testing subsets. For example, the last 100 rows are reserved for testing, while the remainder is used for training.

Model Selection:
A RandomForestClassifier from Scikit-Learn is chosen as the prediction model.

Hyperparameters:
The classifier is instantiated with parameters such as n_estimators (number of trees) and min_samples_split to control the model complexity and prevent overfitting.

Training the Model:
The model is trained using a selected list of predictors. Two versions of prediction functions are defined:

Standard Prediction:
For immediate testing, the model is trained on the training set and used to predict on the test set. The predictions are then evaluated using precision.

Backtesting Function:
A backtest function iteratively splits the dataset (in steps), trains the model, and stores predictions. This simulates a real-world scenario where the model is retrained on progressively updated data. The predictions across all test splits are concatenated for overall evaluation.

Evaluation Metrics:
The notebook calculates the precision score (i.e., the fraction of correct positive predictions) and examines the distribution of predicted classes (0 vs. 1). These metrics help assess model performance.

5. Advanced Feature Engineering (Rolling Windows)
Rolling Averages and Ratios:
For several defined horizons (2, 5, 60, 250, and 1000 days), the notebook computes rolling averages of the Close price.
It then creates new features that capture the ratio of the current close to the rolling mean, along with trends calculated from past target values.
These engineered features are added to the dataset and used as additional predictors for the model.

Final Data Preparation:
After all features are engineered, the dataset is cleaned again by dropping any remaining rows with missing values. The final dataset is used for model training and backtesting.

6. Prediction, Backtesting, and Visualization
Generating Predictions:
The notebook uses the trained model to predict future price movements. Predictions are stored alongside the true target values for later comparison.

Visualization of Predictions:
Finally, the notebook generates plots to compare actual vs. predicted values, enabling visual inspection of the model’s performance over time.

Backtesting Results:
A backtesting routine is executed to simulate trading decisions based on the model predictions. The performance of the predictions is quantified using standard metrics (e.g., precision score), and the distribution of predicted classes is analyzed.

7. Summary and Conclusions
Insights:
The notebook concludes with an analysis of the model performance. For instance, it might highlight the precision achieved, the balance between upward and downward predictions, and any observed trends.

Next Steps:
Potential improvements might include further hyperparameter tuning, experimenting with additional features or alternative models (like LSTM), and refining the backtesting methodology.
